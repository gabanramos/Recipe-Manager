# Recipe-Manager :bread: :baguette_bread: :flatbread:
- Main purpose: Create a Bread Recipe Manager to keep track of ingredients for intelligent ingredient shopping. 
- Goals are:
  - To practice input validation with try/catch blocks
  - Create nested menus
  - Practice UI design
  - Create structure for file reading (next version of the application)

OBS.: Some recipes were provided, with made up quantities for ingredients. For this version, it is not possible to add or remove any ingredient.

## Sections

All the sections have input validation logic applied. Inputs are meant to be only integers, sometimes within a range. User is to be informed if a bad input is read and why it is not accepted.

- Application detects bad input (Strings, out-of-range ints, decimals...), prints a message error, and prevents the software to crash.
